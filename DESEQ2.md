# Differential Expression using DESEQ2.
In this section we will look at differential expression using DESEQ2 ([Love at al. 2014, doi: 10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8)).  DESEQ2 is able to process each individual gene as a lienar model, we can look at the effect of individual variables in addition to the interaction between them.  We will begin from the count data generted during the mapping with START.
